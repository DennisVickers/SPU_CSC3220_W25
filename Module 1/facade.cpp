/* Notes:
 * In this example, ComputerFacade provides a simple method start to turn on the computer.
 * This method handles all the complex processes like loading the CPU, memory, and reading
 * from the hard drive.
 * The client, in this case, the main function, does not need to know about these subsystems
 * and their complexities.
